## Blast from the past
In computer science, assembly language is a low-level programming language that is designed to communicate directly with a computer's hardware. It is a type of programming language that is closer to the machine code the CPU can execute, making it more powerful than other higher-level languages such as C++, Java, or Python. Assembly language programs are typically written in a text editor and then assembled using a specialized software tool called an assembler. An assembler program creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents. Assembly language provides a close-to-hardware abstraction of the underlying computer system, allowing programmers to write specific code that takes advantage of a particular hardware feature of a given computer system. Assembly language is still taught in most computer science and electronic engineering programs, and although few programmers today regularly work with assembly language as a tool, the underlying concepts remain important. Such fundamental topics as binary arithmetic, memory allocation, stack processing, character set encoding, interrupt processing, and compiler design would be hard to study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level.
